## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. We did not setup proper development environment yet, so if you find any bags please report them using email for now.

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to alexmy21/gmds.

- Send email to alexmy@matrixlab.org.

Try to follow Google coding style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

Thanks for contributing!


### Format of the commit message

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

The format can be described more formally as follows:

```
<subsystem>: <what changed>
<BLANK LINE>
<why this change was made>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters. 
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
